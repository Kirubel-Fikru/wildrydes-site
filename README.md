# wildrydes-site
Deploying a serverles web application using Amplify, Lambda, 
Api Gateway, DynamoDb
* In this tutorial, you will create a simple serverless web application that enables users to request unicorn rides from the Wild Rydes fleet.
* The application will present users with an HTML-based user interface for indicating the location where they would like to be picked up and will interact with a RESTful web service on the backend to submit the request and dispatch a nearby unicorn. 
* The application will also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before requesting rides.
